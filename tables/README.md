# Universal tables: Web-based tables showing stats about (S)UD usage of features and relations

This folder contains the website files, a few tables and the python code for the tables construction.
The rendering of the tables is done with [ag-grid JS library](https://www.ag-grid.com/).

## Available tables

The tables are available through the URL http://tables.grew.fr with direct links to the four collections of tables:

* [`http://tables.grew.fr?data=ud_feats/FEATS`](http://tables.grew.fr?data=ud_feats/FEATS): on features usage (only given on UD, on SUD the tables would gives the same observations as SUD does not differ from UD at the feature level);
* [`http://tables.grew.fr?data=ud_deps/DEPS`](http://tables.grew.fr?data=ud_deps/DEPS): on dependency labels usage in the UD project;
* [`http://tables.grew.fr?data=sud_deps/DEPS`](http://tables.grew.fr?data=sud_deps/DEPS): on dependency labels usage in the SUD project;
* [`http://tables.grew.fr?data=meta/META`](http://tables.grew.fr?data=meta/META): on sentences metadata.

## Web interface 
 * Filtering is available on `Rows` (*i.e.* on Treebanks names) or on `Columns` (*i.e.* dependency relation, feature name or feature value).
    * filtering on rows automatically filters the non empty columns
    * filtering on columns automatically filters the non empty rows   
 * Columns are sortable and can be moved
 * Counting in cells is available as:
    * `Occurences` &rarr; the number of times the corresponding element is present in the corpus
    * `Ratio / tokens` &rarr; the `Occurences` number divided by the number of tokens in the corpus
    * `Ratio / sents` &rarr; the `Occurences` number divided by the number of sentences in the corpus
 * Each observation is linked to the corresponding [Grew-match](http://match.grew.fr) request (with a clustering on values in the case of *feature name* tables).

## Issues
Problems, suggestionsâ€¦ can be reported [here](https://github.com/surfacesyntacticud/tools/issues/new?labels=tables).

## Dev info

### Computing tables

The python script `build_table.py` builds the JSON file.
See `python build_table.py --help` or examples in [`Makefile`](./Makefile) for usage. 

### Local rendering of the tables

In the `tables` folder, run the command `python -m http.server`.
Then open of the page http://localhost:8000 to have a local access to the different tables.
