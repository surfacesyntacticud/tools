# Some Python scripts on SUD data

This folder gather some scripts using the [`grewpy`](https://grew.fr/usage/python) Python lib.

We suppose that uptodate versions of `grewpy` and `grewpy_backend` are installed ([Install doc](https://grew.fr/usage/python)).

## make AG-grid based tables
Scripts `double_clust.py`,  `stat_pos_features.py` and `multi_ling.py` build JSON tables prepared to be displayed by AG-grid.

Run `make start` to view the tables locally.

See `Makefile` for usage examples.
